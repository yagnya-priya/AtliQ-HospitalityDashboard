Data Cleaning:
Data cleaning is a crucial step in preparing your data for analysis in Power BI. The Power Query Editor in Power BI provides a robust set of tools for cleaning and transforming your data.
Missing values:
1.	 In the fact_bookings table, we identified missing values in the ratings_given column.
2.	To handle the missing values, we used the mean of the non-missing ratings to impute the missing values.
3.	This approach ensured that the imputed values were representative of the existing data, maintaining the overall distribution and preventing the distortion of analytical outcomes.
Outliers:
1.	Rows where the revenue_generated was below the lower limit or above the higher limit were identified as outliers.
2.	Rows with revenue exceeding the higher limit were removed from the dataset to minimize the impact of outliers on subsequent analyses.
Data Modelling:
Data modeling involves creating a logical structure for organizing and analyzing data. The provided datasets include dim_date.csv, dim_hotels.csv, dim_rooms.csv, fact_aggregated_bookings.csv, and fact_bookings.csv. These datasets can be used to create a logical data model (LDM) with relationships between them. The LDM Modeler in tools like Good Data can be used to create datasets, relationships, and datasets. This enables date-based analysis and supports aggregation at different levels.
